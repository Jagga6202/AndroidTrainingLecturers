What is Activity and Activity Lifecycle

An activity is an application component that provides a screen with which users can interact in order to do something, such as dial the phone, take a photo, send an email, or view a map. Each activity is given a window in which to draw its user interface.

Its a predefined class in Android and in order to have any UI components in your app you must inherit this class.


Android Activity Lifecycle is controlled by 7 methods.

1)onCreate()
   This is the first callback and called when the activity is first created.
2)onStart()
   This callback is called when the activity becomes visible to the user.
3)onResume()
   This is called when the user starts interacting with the application.
4)onPause()
   The paused activity does not receive user input and cannot execute any code and called 
    when the current activity is being paused and the previous activity is being resumed.                             
5)onStop()
    This callback is called when the activity is no longer visible.
6)onRestart()
    This callback is called when the activity restarts after stopping it.
7)onDestroy()
   This callback is called before the activity is destroyed by the system.

Example
private void printLog(String title,String data){
    Log.e(title,data);
}

private String app_name="Lect16";


@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
    printLog(app_name,"onCreate Called");
}

@Override
protected void onStart() {
    super.onStart();
    printLog(app_name,"onStart Called");
}

@Override
protected void onResume() {
    super.onResume();
    printLog(app_name,"onResume Called");
}

@Override
protected void onPause() {
    super.onPause();
    printLog(app_name,"onPause Called");
}

@Override
protected void onStop() {
    super.onStop();
    printLog(app_name,"onStop Called");
}

@Override
protected void onRestart() {
    super.onRestart();
    printLog(app_name,"OnRestart Called");
}

@Override
protected void onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy();
    printLog(app_name,"onDestroy Called");
}
