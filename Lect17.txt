Intent 

Android Intent is the message that is passed between components such as activities, content providers, broadcast receivers, services etc.



There are two types of intent
1)Implicit Intent
  In android, Implicit Intents won’t specify any name of the component to start, instead it declare an action to perform and it allow a component from other app to handle it.

Intent intent=new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
intent.setData(Uri.parse("https://www.google.com"));
startActivity(intent);


2)Explicit Intent

Explicit intents explicitly specify the name of component to be invoked by an activity and we use explicit intents to start a component in our own app.
