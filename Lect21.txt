Difference Between ListView & RecyclerView

1)RecyclerView is an advanced version ListView to use recyclerView you need to add design library in your android studio project no such requirement for ListView.

2)ViewHolder Pattern is Compulsory for RecyclerView which makes its to scroll smoothly.

3)LayoutManager provides Recyclerview to scroll vertical ,horizontal etc but in Listview you can vertical scroll only

4)setOnItemClickListner is not there in Recyclerview,but it is present in Listview

5)Deafult adapter can be used with Listview but we need to use custom adapter in recyclerview


GridLayoutManager example in RecyclerView

recyclerView.setLayoutManager(new GridLayoutManager(this,2));
recyclerView.addItemDecoration(new DividerItemDecoration(this,DividerItemDecoration.HORIZONTAL));
recyclerView.addItemDecoration(new DividerItemDecoration(this,DividerItemDecoration.VERTICAL));

for HORIZONTAL 
recyclerView.setLayoutManager(new LinearLayoutManager(this,LinearLayoutManager.HORIZONTAL,false));
recyclerView.addItemDecoration(new DividerItemDecoration(this,DividerItemDecoration.HORIZONTAL));
