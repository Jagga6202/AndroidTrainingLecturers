Abstraction
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java
1)Abstract class 
A class which is declared as abstract is known as an abstract class. It can have abstract and non-abstract methods. It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.
abstract class Bike{  
  abstract void run();  
}  
class Honda4 extends Bike{  
void run(){System.out.println("running safely");}  
public static void main(String args[]){  
 Bike obj = new Honda4();  
 obj.run();  
}  
}  
2)Interface 
The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
interface printable{  
void print();  
}  
class A6 implements printable{  
public void print(){System.out.println("Hello");}  
  
public static void main(String args[]){  
A6 obj = new A6();  
obj.print();  
 }  
}
