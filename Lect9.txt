Spinner
Android spinner is like the drop down menu with multiple values from which the end user can select only one value.
Android spinner is associated with AdapterView. So you need to use one of the adapter classes with spinner.
Adapter is  a bridge between an AdapterView and the underlying data for that view.
An AdapterView is a group of widgets (aka view) components in Android that include the ListView, Spinner, and GridView.

In Spinner Example we will need to create a list of country and user can select any one from them.we can use the default adapter or custom adapter for that.
